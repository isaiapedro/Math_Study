# Summary

This repository was made to help any ML enthusiasts understand the basic concepts of data science and computing in general through mathematical modelling and syntax.
The content is divided by courses and every course compreends a list of topics displayed below.

This is a work in progress and will take some time before all the fields and every topic is completely reviewed. You are welcomed to use the useful links that are provided in the [Resources](#resources) tab to learn more about each topic.

**Topics**:

# How it Works

- Every course is divided by branch. You can visit the corresponding course using the default dropdown menu or by clicking the link below:
  - [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/tree/linear-algebra)
  - [ODEs and Series](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/tree/odes-and-series)
  - [Calculus](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/tree/calculus)
- In each branch you'll find exercises, topic discussions, examples and more.
- You can also suggest new changes on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/issues) or by creating a pull request with your suggested changes.
- This is not a complete course on Math, but it can serve as a roadmap and a workbook for general ideas and examples for each concept that is useful when approaching Mathematics as a ML/Data Science student.

# Resources

Below I listed some resources that may be helpful for you.

### Linear Algebra
Linear algebra combines multivariate calculus, differential equations, and probability into a widely applicable mathematical theory and system that undergirds many technologies in our lives.

**Topics covered:**
`Vector and matrix calculations`
`Linear transformations`
`Vector spaces`

### Calculus 
Calculus is the study of change (differential calculus) and accumulation of quantities (integral calculus). As the cornerstone of geometry and physics, it serves as the foundation for understanding many natural phenomena and plays an essential role in modern technology, scientific discovery, and many fields, including engineering, economics, and medicine.

**Topics Covered:**
`Derivatives`
`Integrals`

### Introduction to Differential Equations
Differential equations describe the science of change: the route by which natural and man-made systems move from one state to another. Epidemics, population growth, and weather patterns are all modeled using differential equations. It provides us a mathematical language to describe physical, chemical, and biological systems and their evolution.

**Topics covered:**
`First-order ODEs`
`Second-order ODEs`
